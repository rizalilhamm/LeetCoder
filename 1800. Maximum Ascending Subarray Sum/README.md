## LeetCode Question: Maximum Ascending Subarray Sum

**Problem Link**: [Maximum Ascending Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-ascending-subarray-sum/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-02-26)

### Problem Description:

You are given an integer array `nums`. Your task is to find the sum of the maximum ascending subarray in the array. An ascending subarray is a subarray where every element is strictly greater than the previous one.

You need to return the sum of the maximum ascending subarray.

**Example**:

Input: `nums = [10, 20, 30, 5, 10, 50]`

Output: `65`

Explanation: The maximum ascending subarray is `[10, 20, 30]` with the sum of 60, but the next subarray `[5, 10, 50]` has the sum of 65, which is larger.

---

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`

---

**Note**:
- The solution should be optimized for O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the array.
